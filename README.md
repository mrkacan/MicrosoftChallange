# Microsoft Mobile Challenge
> **NOTES:** 
>> - This application was created for only **IOS** platform.
>> - Used Typescript for type checking, Eslint and Prettier for linting and formatting, Jest and React Native Testing Library for testing to make codebase more robust.
>> - Added basic tests for SignUp screen.
>> - Tried to make app more beautiful and user-friendly. (I hope it's enough for this challenge.)

## Tech Stack
- React, React Native
- Navigation: React Navigation
- State Management: Context API
- Type Checking: TypeScript
- Linting: ESLint
- Formatting: Prettier
- Styling: Styled Components
- Testing: Jest, React Native Testing Library
- Using react-native-error-boundary for error handling
- Using verticalScale, horizontalScale, moderateScale for responsive design

## How to run
### Install dependencies
```bash
yarn or npm install
```

### Run on iOS
```bash
npx pod-install ios
```
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
### Run Tests
```bash
yarn test
```

## What can do as next steps?
- Add more tests (snapshots, unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests)
- Add more comments
- Add more error handling
- UI/UX improvements (Make it pixel perfect)
- For sure need code review to find bugs and quality issues
- Can add more if checks for Camera component
- Can separate SignUp form
- Can add more validations for SignUp form
- Internationalization
- Can implement dark/light mode for styled components

## What was can do better?
- Commits can be more meaningful and separated
- Can test on Android
